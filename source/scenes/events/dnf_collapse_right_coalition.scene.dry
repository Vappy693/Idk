= Hugenberg's exit from the coalition

When Hugenberg established his own party, he successfully attracted a significant number of former <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> Reichstag members to join his party and to oppose the current right-wing coalition. The current government lacks a majority within the Reichstag and may be taken down with a no-confidence vote.

The <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> has indicated their willingness to join the government now that the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> has rid of their radical right elements. [? if center_right_coalition >= 50 : This is enough to form a functional government without us. ?][? if center_right_coalition < 50 : Although, this still doesn't provide a sufficient majority. ?]

[? if center_right_coalition < 50 : We can either vote to bring down the government and hold new elections, or "tolerate" a government led by the remaining bourgeois parties. It would be extremely unpopular within our party to support a government that has the participation of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>—despite their removal of the most extreme factions—would be highly unpopular within our party. ?]

The bourgeois has survived without our toleration, but it's unlikely that this governing arrangement will last much longer.

By supporting the government, we have essentially entered into a "toleration" arrangement with the [+ chancellor +] government. We do not have a voice in the government, but we are responsible for its continued stability. This is wildly unpopular within the party and our supporters, as we allowed a right-wing government to form twice now.

We have an opportunity to change the composition of the Prussian coalition.
