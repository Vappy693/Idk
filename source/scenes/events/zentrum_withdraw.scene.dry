= Weimar Plan Collapse

A crisis! The Center Party has abandoned the Weimar Plan at a recent party congress, removing it from their party platform and cancelling plans for further joint rallies. They believe the crisis has subsided and there is no purpose to further cooperation. [? if unemployed >= 13 : This is despite the best attempts of Joseph Joos to rally the Catholic trade unions to the plan's defense. ?]

The Left and Center have, feeling vindicated, renewed their dissent, with the Left calling for a pivot towards the Communists for reliable allies against fascism. Meanwhile the [+ ddp_name +]'s status is uncertain, with some in their party calling to also move on.

We have definitively broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@troubling

With the Weimar Plan's discrediting in other parties, its future even within Social Democracy becomes uncertain.
