Brüning immediately begins to cut welfare using his emergency powers granted by President [+ president +]. We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.
