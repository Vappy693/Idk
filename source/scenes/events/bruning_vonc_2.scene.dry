= Tax reform

Due to the crisis of the Great Depression, government budgets have fallen and welfare spending has risen substantially. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has proposed another reform of German finances featuring unpopular tax increases.

Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has used Article 48 of the constitution for the first time in order to pass the bill. In response, a motion has been put forward to rescind the government's emergency powers, and if it succeeds, [+ chancellor +] is prepared to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections.
