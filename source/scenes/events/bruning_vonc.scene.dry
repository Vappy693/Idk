= Vote of no confidence

Following the collapse of the Grand coalition, President Hindenburg has appointed Heinrich Br端ning of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> Party in a government supported by bourgeois forces. However, they cannot survive without the support from us or the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>. 

Br端ning, has reorganized his cabinet to include the parties to the right of the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], such as the <span style="color: #b8996f;">**WP**</span> and let the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> take over as Minister of Agriculture, presumably to pressure the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> to support his government. We are left with the choice to "tolerate" the government to prevent the gains of extremists within the Reichstag or vote to oust Br端ning for new elections.

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. We also repealed their emergency powers. Westarp and his group of moderates that still remain within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> are outraged with Hugenberg letting the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> takedown [+ chancellor +]'s right-wing government, and resign en masse.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. However the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> surprisingly votes in favor with the government, preventing new elections from being called.

Their support of the cabinet is unreliable, with Hugenberg at the helm. It's a matter of time before a crisis takes down the cabinet.

We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.
