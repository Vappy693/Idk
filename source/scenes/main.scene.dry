In foreign policy, we have reached agreements with the Western powers and the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span> that might make genuine peace a reality. <br><br> Now, the task of <span style="color: #c00000;">Social Democracy</span> is to prepare for the next election. The <span style="color: #000000;">bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> government of Wilhelm Marx is unpopular, and we stand to gain. Perhaps the next government will have a <span style="color: #c00000;">socialist</span> majority. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1928 and month = 6 : The poor showing for the liberal parties has convinced their leadership that Germany no longer has the luxury of two liberal parties. However, the prospect of a merger is held back by the left <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and the right <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>, who are strongly against compromising their own interests.

Stresemann is growing disillusioned with his own party, viewing it as a vehicle for industrial interests rather than liberal values. The leftists in the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> argue that the merger would have to take into account the interests of the working class, a policy vehemently opposed by the industrial interests. ?]{!</p>!}

This is begrudgingly accepted by the extremes of both parties to increase their parliamentary influence with the declining liberal vote. <br><br> A new Liberal Association has been gaining traction with funding from both parties, and are expected to open up state and local chapters and to draft a policy program.

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1928 and n_elections == 1 and next_election_time - time = 2: Our calls for new elections just after the last one have pushed the liberal parties closer together, in order to not face any further decline. A new Liberal Association has emerged coordinating the efforts of the two parties and seems to be the prelude to the founding of a new liberal party, but it's not certain if both parties would fully agree. <br><br> The idea of a liberal parliamentary faction has gained considerable traction with both parties and they are likely to negotiate as a single bloc after the election. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if lvp_merger_timer == 4: The quest towards liberal unity has advanced, with the Liberal Association's influence growing within local chapters of the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> chapters on the local level.

Meanwhile, numerous liberal youth organizations have been created with the goal of fostering cooperation between <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> for a united middle party. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="dnvp">!}[? if year = 1928 and month = 9 : Westarp's refusal to run for re-election has left the moderate anti-Hugenberg forces within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> without a candidate.

However, the right wing of the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> holds significant sway over the party and the negotiations, prompting Stresemann to call for an emergency party congress to resolve the issue. ?]{!</p>!}

He strikes a strong parallel with Lambach in working to expand the party to attract all sectors of society.

Another democracy has fell to authoritarianism. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 5 : Dollfuß's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> dictatorship has banned the <span style="color: #700000;">Austrian Communists</span> and the paramilitary of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span>, the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span>. He has also established the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Fatherland Front</span>, a party promoting a far-right <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascist</span> and corporate ideology. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1933 and month = 11 : The <span style="color: #EF1C27;">Spanish Socialists</span> and the <span style="color: #E25822;">Republican Left</span> have suffered an overwhelming defeat at the hands of the right wing <span style="color: #303180;">**CEDA**</span> and increasingly right-wing <span style="color: #A871A8;">Radicals</span>. ?]{!</p>!}

{!<p class="other">!}[? if year = 1934 and month = 2 and not austrian_parliament_seen: The Austrian Civil War has begun and ended in a matter of three days, fought between the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Republican Protection League</span> and Austria's <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Austrofascist</span> regime, resulting in a defeat for the <span style="color: #C8102E;">socialists</span> across the border. The uprising was sparked by efforts to suppress the remnants of the <span style="color: #C8102E;">Austrian Social Democrats</span> and their paramilitary wing. However, the poorly coordinated and weakened movement was swiftly crushed by the army. Perhaps things would have gone more differently if they have taken up arms earlier. ?]{!</p>!}
