= The Weimar Plan

Following our decision to adopt the Reformist economic plan, some have called for us to canvas the plan through the "<span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span>" parties of <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span> and the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> so as to create a common economic plan for the republican parties to rally around together and combat extremism. [? if neorevisionism == 1 : The neorevisionists have joined in these calls and see it as a great way to create a mass movement to defend the republic. ?] [? if in_weimar_coalition == 1 : This will be made easier by the fact that we are already governing as part of a coalition with the parties in question. ?] [? if in_grand_coalition == 1 : This will be made harder by opposition to the idea from the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> in our government, who will influence <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span> and <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> against the idea. ?]

[? if pro_republic < 40 : Such a show of democratic solidarity bolsters republican forces, but as extremist and anti-democratic rhetoric has recently entered the mainstream, many who hear our message remain unconvinced, and many on the Left of the party even criticize the rally and our alignment with the bourgeois parties. ?] [? if pro_republic < 60 and pro_republic > 40 : Such a show of democratic solidarity bolsters republican forces, helping match the now prevalent anti-democratic rhetoric from the far-left and far-right, though many on the Left oppose our decision to align with the bourgeois parties. ?] [? if pro_republic > 60 : Such a show of democratic solidarity has greatly bolstered republican forces, helping combat the increasingly prevalent anti-democratic rhetoric from the far-left and far-right. Nevertheless, some on the Left of the party still oppose our alignment with the bourgeois parties. ?]

We have made great progress in convincing <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span> and the <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**DDP**</span> to adopt our economic plan, and the right-wing of <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span> is finally willing to agree, but desire concessions first.

- @promise_them_cuts: Agree to the bourgeois plans to cut welfare.
- @use_our_relationship: Use our relations to sway them.
- @resource_gift: Use our party resources to convince them.
- @presidential_pressure_braun: Use pressure from President Braun to force the issue.
- @drop_the_matter: This isn't working out. We'll bide our time and maybe they'll adopt it later.

Fine. By cutting welfare, we have appeased the right-wing of <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span>.

Fine. By using our party resources we have appeased the right-wing of <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span>.

By applying pressure with President Braun we have managed to cow the right-wing of <span style="color: #000000;">Zentrum</span>.

Whether it be due to a change in strategy or lacking the means to convince our allies, we have decided to drop the idea for now.

We will keep the SPD party program as the SPD's party program solely, and we will not enter into any unnecessary alliances with the bourgeois parties.

It is too soon to decide whether or not to attempt this so-called <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Plan or not.

We have chosen to postpone our canvassing efforts for the time being[? if left_strength > neorevisionist_strength + (reformist_strength/2) : , due to invigorated opposition from the Left ?]. Only time will tell if this is a temporary change in policy or a permanent abandonment of the <span style="color: #000000;">We</span><span style="color: #DD0000;">im</span><span style="color: #FFCC00;">ar</span> Plan.
