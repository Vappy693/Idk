The key to peace in Europe is a rapprochement between <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and Germany. We are taking steps towards that rapprochement.

We also aim to improve relations with our eastern neighbors, <span style="color: #DC143C;">Pol</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">and</span> and <span style="color: #11457E;">Czech</span><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">oslo</span><span style="color: #D7141A;">vakia</span>, who are rightfully terrified of German aggression.

The <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span> also suffered from the international order created by the Treaty of Versailles; they have been participating in our secret rearmament program. The Treaty of Rapallo in 1922 affirmed our friendly relations.

The <span style="color: #940000;">Soviets</span> are asking for economic and developmental assistance. They are still a poor country on the whole, and are desperately trying to catch up to the western powers. There is a chance that our <span style="color: #FF0000;">anti</span>-<span style="color: #700000;">communist</span> coalition partners would be upset, but we could assuage them by asking the <span style="color: #940000;">Soviets</span> for secret assistance in training and equipping the Reichswehr.

- @soviet_economic_aid_yes_mil: Provide aid, in exchange for Reichswehr assistance.

The <span style="color: #940000;">Soviets</span> are slightly upset, but they seemed to expect this answer.

We also mention the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> in our conversations with the <span style="color: #940000;">Soviet</span> ambassador. They claim that the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is entirely independent of the <span style="color: #940000;">Soviet</span> government, and that the conflict is Thälmann's doing. But, soon after our conversation we notice a slight improvement in attitudes from the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>.

Of course <span style="color: #8B0000;">Stalin</span> and the various leaders of the <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span> know about the Wittorf Affair, but they do not seem to know that we know as well. The <span style="color: #D50000;">Comintern</span> was planning to build a narrative around the affair that absolves Thälmann, but perhaps now they will be less inclined to defend him.

The right has long desired closer ties with Austria, with the eventual goal of the merger of the two German-speaking countries. A customs union with Austria is the first step towards this goal. Additionally, many believe that a union with Austria would improve our current economic circumstances.

However, the Allies, especially <span style="color: #002654;">France</span>, are likely to object. This agreement would break the terms of the Versailles Treaty, and could lead to economic sanctions, further hurting our economy.

- @customs_union_2: Yes, do it!

We have formed a customs union with Austria! The right-wing parties are praising us for this unexpected turn of events.

Immediately, <span style="color: #002654;">France</span> and other neighboring countries lodge their protests. The longer-term response is yet to be seen.

Negotiations proceed smoothly for the most part. The Western powers are convinced of Germany's sincerity and goodwill. [? if nationalism <= 50 or pacifism >= 3 : They are pleased to see that we are renouncing militarism. ?]

Finally, given both the economic circumstances and our continued negotiations, the <span style="color: #0A3161;">Western</span> <span style="color: #C8102E;">Allies</span> are willing to pause our reparations payments! Much of the credit must go to <span style="color: #0A3161;">Western</span> president Hoover, who has been friendlier towards us than the <span style="color: #001489;">Europeans</span>.

This has reduced tensions within our government, and our party has gotten credit for the achievement.

The previous foreign ministry, despite its benevolent and peaceful face, was secretly helping the Reichswehr to build up its forces, in contravention of the Treaty of Versailles.

The Allies are grateful of our exposure and repudiation of militarism. Our partners in the coalition are less supportive.

The Roman Catholic Church is interested in furthering relations with the German Republic, seeing us as preferable to the old anti-Catholic policies of the Empire. We are working towards the signing of a Concordat, an agreement between the Vatican and the Republic that formally recognizes the Church's rights and interests in the country. The <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> is especially interested in making this agreement. The liberal parties are against this idea.

[? if family_law : Our liberalized divorce policies make it difficult to build relations with the Vatican. ?] [? if abortion : Our legalization of abortion make it difficult to connect with the Church. ?] [? if z_leader == "Kaas" : Kaas from the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> is able to use his connections to speed up negotiations. ?]

We have successfully signed a Concordat between Germany and the Roman Catholic Church! This treaty defines a formal relationship between the Church and the German state, guaranteeing freedom of worship for Catholics, and the right of the church to appoint their own clergy.

Along with <span style="color: #002654;">France</span>, <span style="color: #C8102E;">Great Britain</span>, and many other states of Western and Eastern Europe, we have signed a treaty to form a <span style="color: #001489;">European</span> <span style="color: #FFDD00;">Union</span>! It is hoped that <span style="color: #001489;">Europe</span> has learned the lessons of the Great War; never again will there be another war that tears the continent apart.

A major component of the union is the free movement of people and goods across the countries of Europe, as well as the stabilization of currency exchange rates. This provides new markets for German products and new sources of investment.

<span style="color: #7A3C00;">Fascist</span> Italy remains a problem, and the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span> also lies outside the system. But for now, there is new hope for peace and prosperity throughout the continent.
